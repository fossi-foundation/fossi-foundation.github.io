It's that time of year again. Following on from the FOSSi Foundation's
[Latch-Up](http://latch-up.io) and [WOSH](https://fossi-foundation.org/wosh/) events, [ORConf](https://orconf.org) is now less than 3 months away and if
you haven't heard, we're hosting it in beautiful Bordeaux, France over
the weekend of September 27 to 29.

ORConf is in its 8th year of bringing the open source silicon
community together for a weekend of presentations, ideas and
discussions. We hope many of our fine past attendees will make the
trip to France to join us again for what should be another fantastic
event.

If you plan on coming along then please register [here](https://orconf.org/#register).

If you are joining us in a professional capacity, please consider
purchasing a professional ticket [here](https://orconf.org/#ticket).

Presentation submissions are now open. We welcome everyone to come and
tell us about your project, endeavour or your open source silicon use
story. Presentation submissions may be made [here](https://orconf.org/#present)

The call for sponsors goes out again this year  - ORConf isn't free to
run and we rely on the generous support of companies and individuals
to help put the event on. At this stage all sponsorship opportunities
are available - so if you'd like to help the FOSSi Foundation fund the
event, and get a great bit of recognition for it, then please get in
touch with us via replying to this email or via the links on
[orconf.org](https://orconf.org).

So save the date and join us in Bordeaux for what will be another fantastic year of presentations and time spent face to face with the rest of the open source silicon community.
