The FOSSi Foundation is pleased to announce that [ORConf 2018](https://orconf.org) will be held over the weekend of September 21 to 23 in Gdansk, Poland. This year marks the 7th installment of ORConf, and we're very grateful to the [Gdansk University of Technology](https://eti.pg.edu.pl/main-menu) for hosting the event.

ORConf is a conference for open source digital, semiconductor and embedded systems design collaborators and users. Each year attendees are treated to an ever-impressive array of presentations from all corners of the open source hardware space.

ORConf will continue to be free to attend, and we're on the look-out for potential sponsors of this year's event. Please [get in touch](mailto:orconf@fossi-foundation.org) if you'd like to find out more about our sponsorship packages.

Presentation submissions are now being accepted via [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/sP5otWAbv72gheU33), so whether you've attended in years gone by or not, please do feel welcome to join us (again) and share a status update on your project, or equally for users and adopters of open source hardware projects with an interesting story to tell, please do also considering joining us and presenting your experience.

To stay in the loop, subscribe to the [orconf-announce list](https://lists.librecores.org/listinfo/orconf-announce). We'll be in touch via that list when attendance registration opens.

As usual the [ORConf.org site](https://orconf.org) will always have the most up to date information.

So save the date and join us in Gdansk for what should be another fantastic year of presentations and time spent face to face with the rest of the open source digital design community.
