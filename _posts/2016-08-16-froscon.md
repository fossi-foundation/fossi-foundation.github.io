The time to get started with digital hardware development has never been better. Tools are more readily available, FPGAs get cheaper and reasonably sized boards can be obtained easily. Yet hardware development looks like a scary place to many developers coming from the software world. Sometimes it's just naming that's different, sometimes it's missing documentation and being lost in choices that make it hard to dive in.

At FOSSi we're trying to spread the word about the joy of digital hardware design. And we did so once more this weekend at FrOSCon, a great free and open source conference in St. Augustin, close to Bonn in Germany. 

Both the <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/froscon2016-1817-how_to_design_your_own_chip">video</a> and <a href="//www.slideshare.net/PhilippWagner7/how-to-design-your-own-chip">the presentation slides</a> are online. 
Thanks to all the people who worked hard on organizing the conference and doing the recordings!
