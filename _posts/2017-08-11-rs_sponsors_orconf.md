LONDON, UK, 11 August, 2017 - [RS Components](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/) (RS), the trading brand of [Electrocomponents plc](http://www.electrocomponents.com/) (LSE:ECM), the global distributor for engineers, is sponsoring [ORConf](https://orconf.org/), an open source digital design and embedded systems conference that covers from the transistor level up to Linux user space and beyond — featuring presentations and discussion on free and open source IP projects, implementations on FPGA and in silicon, verification, EDA tools, licensing and embedded software, to name but a few. 

Conference hosts in previous years have included University of Bologna and CERN, and this year ORConf is being hosted as part of the [Wuthering Bytes](http://wutheringbytes.com/) technology festival in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire (UK). Stefan Wallentowitz, a director of conference organisers [The Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation](https://fossi-foundation.org/), said: “We’re thrilled to be joining the Wuthering Bytes festival for ORConf 2017 and it’s really great to have the support of RS Components as a major sponsor of the conference this year”.

Pete Wood, Head Technology Evangelist at RS commented: “We are seeing a significant growth in interest in open source digital design, due in part to lower cost and increasingly capable FPGA development platforms, but also thanks to increased online collaboration and the relatively new RISC-V open instruction set (ISA) architecture gaining in popularity. RS have long been supporters of Wuthering Bytes and this year we are delighted to be able to support ORConf, which fits well with our mission of empowering engineers, spreading knowledge, enabling design reuse and fostering collaboration.”

Wuthering Bytes 2017 will take place over the course of 10 days, running from 1st - 10th September, with ORConf being hosted on Friday 8th through to Sunday 10th.  For further details see the ORConf and Wuthering Bytes websites:
