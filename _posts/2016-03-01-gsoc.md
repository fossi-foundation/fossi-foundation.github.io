The Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation has been accepted as a
mentoring organization in
[Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). We
are very happy about this great opportunity to mentor students around
the world that want to contribute to FOSSi projects and the FOSSi
ecosystem.

We have put up a [list of project ideas](/gsoc16-ideas.html). Students
can find the ideas there and a list of the important dates. We highly
encourage students to come up with their own ideas and bring them
either directly to us at
[gsoc@fossi-foundation.org](mailto:gsoc@fossi-foundation.org) or post
to our
[mailing list](https://lists.librecores.org/listinfo/discussion).

We are looking forward to a great Google Summer of Code!
