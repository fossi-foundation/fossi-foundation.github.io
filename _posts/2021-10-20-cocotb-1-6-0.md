The [cocotb project](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb) is proud to announce the immediate release of its new version 1.6.0.
cocotb is a COroutine based COsimulation TestBench environment for verifying VHDL/Verilog RTL using Python.

Cocotb can be installed and updated from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/cocotb/) through pip:

```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade cocotb
```

For full installation instructions refer to the documentation at <https://docs.cocotb.org/en/v1.6.0/install.html>.

This release concludes a seven month development period.
Instead of going directly to cocotb 2.0, we threw in another backwards-compatible release in the 1.x release series with a number of exciting new features, and deprecations for functionality we will change in cocotb 2.0.

All users of cocotb are strongly encouraged to look through the deprecations when running their tests and future-proof their testbenches as time permits!

Read on for some of the highlights in this release.


## New ways to schedule coroutines

Coroutines are at the heart of cocotb -- it's even in our name!
Since early on coroutines could be scheduled to run concurrently with `cocotb.fork()`.
*That still works* -- but now there's a better way as well, and we encourage you to update your code.

In cocotb 1.6, we're introducing a new way of scheduling coroutines using `cocotb.start_soon()`.
Additionally, we're introducing two less commonly used functions, `await cocotb.start()`, and `cocotb.create_task()`.

Before we go into the details, the quick porting advice is:
**In most cases, you can simply replace `cocotb.fork()` with `cocotb.start_soon()`.**

### Coroutine basics

To understand the differences between the various ways of scheduling a coroutine we need to first recap the basics behind them.
A *coroutine function*, in cocotb, is a Python function declared with `async def`.
Coroutines *can* be executed in parallel -- in theory.
In practice, there's only one coroutine running at any given time.
So we need to choose which one gets to execute.

Two potential solutions come to mind: we could, option one, introduce a "moderator" which allows, for example, a first task to execute for a bit, and then lets a second one execute, and so on.
Or, option two, we could teach tasks (at moments they find suitable) to ask around if other tasks would like to do some work as well, and pass over control to them.
Coroutines (not only in cocotb) implement the second concept: be nice to each other, and give up control when no work is left for the moment.

In cocotb, you use the `await` statement to *yield* control, that is, give up control and indicate that another coroutine may now execute.
The execution resumes in the line after the `await` statement once the event specified after `await` has happened.

### Schedule a coroutine using cocotb.start_soon()

<img src="/assets/posts/2021-10-20-cocotb-1-6-0/scheduling_start_soon.png" style="max-width:100%" />

That's a lot of introduction: let's get back to `cocotb.fork()`, `cocotb.start_soon()`, and `await cocotb.start()`.
What's common to all these three functions is that they *schedule* a coroutine, which only means: these functions let cocotb know that a coroutine exists, and that it would like to run at some point.
The cocotb scheduler will then take care of the rest.

What distinguishes the three functions is what they do in addition to scheduling the given coroutine.

For `cocotb.start_soon()` the answer is easy: nothing.
A coroutine is only introduced to the scheduler, which will hand over control to it as soon as another coroutine gives up control.

Let's have a look at the figure above to understand how the scheduling could look.
Assume `coro3()` has been scheduled earlier and is ready to execute.
`coro2()` is scheduled by `coro1()`.
Since we're using `cocotb.start_soon()`, `coro2()` is only scheduled, but not executed until `coro1()` yields control using an `await` statement.

At this point, also `coro3()` will execute, and ultimately, control will return to `coro1()`.

### Schedule and run coroutines using await cocotb.start()

<img src="/assets/posts/2021-10-20-cocotb-1-6-0/scheduling_start.png" style="max-width:100%" />

Things looks slightly different when using `await cocotb.start()`: `cocotb.start()` schedules a coroutine, *and immediately yields control* to let *any* other coroutine execute.
Since `cocotb.start()` yields control, it needs to be used in conjunction with `await`.

As shown in the figure, once `coro1()` yields control, both `coro2()` and `coro3()` run.
Only then control returns to `coro1()`.

You can think of `await cocotb.start()` as a combination of `cocotb.start_soon()` and `await NullTrigger()`, which is a trigger that immediately fires.

In almost all cases you won't need the immediate trigger that `await cocotb.start()` provides, and you can use `cocotb.start_soon()` instead.

### The old way: cocotb.fork()

<img src="/assets/posts/2021-10-20-cocotb-1-6-0/scheduling_fork.png" style="max-width:100%" />

Finally, there's the third and "old" way of scheduling a coroutine: `cocotb.fork()`.
`cocotb.fork()` schedules the coroutine, executes *only this* coroutine until the next `await` statement, and then returns to the caller.
In the figure above, `coro1()` forks off `coro2()`, which then executes until the next `await` statement.
Then execution returns to `coro1()` and it executes until it yields control in an `await` statement.
Only then can all other coroutines, e.g. `coro3()` do their work.

We deprecated `cocotb.fork()` because it has slightly odd behavior (by today's standards, of course):
* `cocotb.fork()` gives up control, but isn't a async function which needs an `await` in front of it.
* `cocotb.fork()` yields control "only a bit" to let exactly one other coroutine execute, but in a way which is rather unique.
* And finally there are a several other corner cases in error handling which are very hard or impossible to get right with `cocotb.fork()`, and which many users have painfully experienced over the years.

**`cocotb.fork()` is deprecated, but it will remain available in cocotb 1.x.
We encourage you to migrate your testbenches to the new scheduling routines, most likely by simply replacing `cocotb.fork()` with `cocotb.start_soon()`.
Have a look at [PR #2713](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/pull/2713/files) for how we did the conversion in cocotb itself.**


### Further reading

If you'd like to know more about coroutines and scheduling in cocotb have a look at the [Coroutines and Tasks section](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/v1.6.0/coroutines.html#coroutines) in the documentation (which also explains the `cocotb.create_task()` function, which we skipped here).

## They are your type: HDL datatypes

Datatypes are behind every line of code in your editor.
When you write `logic [3:0] my_signal` in SystemVerilog datatypes are clearly visible.
But datatypes are there even if you don't explicitly write them down, as in `my_signal <= -2` in cocotb.

Right now, cocotb is [fairly relaxed about HDL datatypes](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/v1.6.0/writing_testbenches.html#reading-values-from-signals), and freely converts between them as needed mostly through its `BinaryValue` class (which is behind the `my_signal` assignment seen before).
However, being relaxed isn't always helpful, as some cocotb users have found out: conversions can go wrong, and expressiveness can be be lost.

Starting with cocotb 1.6, we're introducing datatypes which model common HDL data types: `Logic` for four-state logic values, `Bit` for two-state logic, `Array` and `LogicArray` for HDL-style arrays or vectors.
All these new types have been carefully designed to feel natural for both VHDL and SystemVerilog programmers, and to provide type safety and useful typecasts.

As of now these datatypes [can be used in custom testbench code](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/v1.6.0/library_reference.html#hdl-datatypes).
Going forward, we plan to bake these types more deeply into cocotb, and make signal handles return them.

## Assigning values to signals using `<=` is deprecated

One of the unique, but also slightly obscure, features of cocotb is on its way out:
Setting values on handles using the `my_signal <= newval` syntax is now deprecated.
Please use `my_signal.value = newval` instead.

We didn't take this decision lightly (it's more typing, after all!), but there are good reasons for it.

* First of all, the syntax doesn't always work (and there's no way of fixing it).
  Quiz: What do you think `a <= b if c else d` does?
  ([Answer](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/issues/2658))
* It's not obvious what `<=` does for someone who knows Python.
  We got asked many times, and every presentation introducing cocotb has to explain it.
  It's even hard to google for it!
* Finally, `<=` provides more than one way of doing things, which is bad for teaching and learning cocotb.

So if you have a spare moment, open the search-replace dialog of your favorite editor, and get rid of a couple `<=` assignments!

## GPI +- cocotb

Cocotb does a lot of hard work to provide a common interface between simulators and your Python testbench.
Within cocotb, this abstraction layer is called GPI.
So how about a crazy idea: you want to write your own cocotb-like framework in Python, but don't want to do the hard work of creating an abstracted interface to all those simulators out there?
You can do that now by providing a custom entry point, which is a Python module which implements a couple functions.
This feature is *experimental* and isn't guaranteed to stay this way going forward, but that shouldn't discourage you from giving it a try (but don't get too excited just yet and build your whole infrastructure around it!).

## Build system improvements

A staple of cocotb releases are improvements to its testbench build system.
This time around, key improvements are:

* ModelSim, Questa, and Xcelium now support compilation into a named VHDL library lib using `VHDL_SOURCES_<lib>`.
* A new `SIM_CMD_PREFIX` Makefile variable can be used to prefix simulation commands. This feature is helpful to run commands in GDB, add a library using `LD_PRELOAD`, or run commands through a job scheduler.
