                  For six years, OpenPiton has provided hardware designs, build and verification scripts, and other infrastructure to enable efficient, detailed research into manycores and systems-on-chip.
                  It enables open-source hardware development through its open design and support of a plethora of open simulators and CAD tools.
                  OpenPiton was first designed to perform cutting-edge computer architecture research at Princeton University and opening it up to the public has led to thousands of downloads and numerous academic publications spanning many subfields within computing.

                <p>
                  In this talk, Jonathan will share some of the lessons learned during the development of OpenPiton, provide examples of how OpenPiton has been used to efficiently test novel research ideas, and discuss how OpenPiton has evolved due to its open development and feedback from the open-source community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  About the speaker: Jonathan is the lead developer of the OpenPiton platform and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

                Unlike the wider software world, Electronic Design Automation
                (EDA) open-source landscape has been fragmented for a long time,
                requiring significant effort and knowledge in a variety of
                disciplines to assemble a working ASIC flow. This has changed
                with projects such as Qflow and OpenROAD that aim at developing
                open-source toolchain for digital layout generation from RTL.
              </p>

              <p>
                OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on available
                opensource EDA tools configured/tuned for the SkyWater 130nm
                PDK. OpenLane main objective is to generate a clean layout from
                RTL designs in less than 24-hours with zero human interventions.
                OpenLane has been used, successfully, to tape-out a family of
                test chips (striVe).

                In a collaborative effort with Google and SkyWater, efabless'
                team has designed and implemented the striVe SoC family using
                SkyWater's SKY130 130nm process, efabless' OpenLANE RTL2GDS
                no-human-in-the-loop SoC compiler and several key FOSS
                components including standard cell and IO libraries from
                SkyWater and OSU, Dual port SRAM created using OpenRAM, PicoRV32
                RISC-V CPU and future versions that will include open source

                6 configurations which will be publicly released to the design
                community as concrete designs currently on their way to
                manufacturing. Being truly FOSS and foundry-enabled, the striVe
                SoC family will serve as physical demonstrators and be the seed
                for countless community-defined and designed SoC's stretching
                the limits of innovation and to serve select commercial markets.

              <p>Existing design flows and tools require excessive design costs
                to achieve the power, area, and performance requirements of
                complex system-on-chip (SoC) solutions. Consequently, the
                semiconductor industry needs high-level synthesis tools that
                provide the ability to quickly develop and accurately evaluate
                complex SoC solutions. These tools should provide accurate area,
                delay, and power estimates from high-level SoC architecture
                descriptions. They should also provide support for a wide
                variety of components including embedded memories, mixed-signal
                designs, custom and standard cell circuits,
                high-performance/low-power processors, and communication
                structures, such as buses and on-chip networks. In addition to
                being well documented, easy to use, and publicly available, the
                design flows should work in conjunction with industry-standard
                design tools.

                This project will provide publicly-available
                high-level synthesis tools for complex SoC solutions for the

                designers to quickly develop and evaluate high-performance,
                low-power systems. They also provide an improved understanding
                of area, performance, and power tradeoffs in SoC designs. The
                instructional materials and sample SoC architectures provided
                are useful for engineers, edu- cators, and students, who are new
                to the area of SoC design, as well. Most importantly, the tools
                are designed to be free and open-source software (FOSS) and
                integrate with tools from eFabless as well as other open-source

              PDK, we can show how magic does interactive and batch DRC;
              density, stress, latchup, and antenna rules, and much more.

              The SkyWater OpenPDK SKY130 was released to the open community on June 30, 2020. It was a major milestone in opening new fronts in the semiconductor industry. Hundreds of community members joined the movement and started using the PDK in a variety of designs.

              On November 30 2020, more than 40 designers and design teams committed to submit their work on mpw-one, the first of 6 shuttles Google is funding to engage the community. Teams experience range from a freshman in college to companies like IBM, QuickLogic and Western Digital. The designs included several RISC-V cores and SoCs, four eFPGAs, OpenPOWER SoC, Analog/RF designs and an MRAM!

              Mohamed will shed more light on the fantastic outcomes of the first shuttle, its content, plans for testing and the plan for the next shuttle.

                <a href="https://cocotb.org">Cocotb</a> is a highly productive hardware verification approach using Python as test language.
                Since its first release in 2013 cocotb has constantly grown in popularity.
                Which is great! And a challenge.
                Providing support to users, agreeing on a development roadmap, and ultimately implementing, testing and releasing features and bug fixes requires a lot of resources -- certainly more than one or two developers can provide.
                After a more quiet period cocotb is now maintained collaboratively by a group of maintainers, which has solved the capacity issues nicely.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this talk, Philipp will present a bit of history on cocotb, how maintaining popular software is challenging, and ways the cocotb project found useful to solve those issues.
                Of course we'll also look at some of the newest features of cocotb and how they make verifying hardware even more productive.
              </p>
              <p>About the speaker: Philipp is one of the maintainers of cocotb, a FOSSi Foundation director, and hardware and software engineer at lowRISC in Cambridge, UK.</p>
