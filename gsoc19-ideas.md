### Create your own LibreCores, or contribute to an existing one

*Details:* Our main goal is to grow the community around open source silicon
designs. LibreCores are IP cores, but they are free and open. While
there are many projects you can contribute too, you may have your own
great idea for a LibreCore. All projects start small, and we see this
is a great chance to bring forward new ideas and start building new
tiny bits and pieces that enable free and open source chips.

We are happy to mentor you with your own idea, but it is important
that it is re-usable and contains everything needed for simple and
flexible integration, like testbenches, the required software drivers
etc. So, it is important that you discuss a proposal intensively.

*Skill level:* All

*Language/Tool:* Verilog, VHDL, Chisel, TL-Verilog, ...

*Mentor:* We will find the mentor with you,
 [LibreCores GSoC team](mailto:gsoc@fossi-foundation.org)


### Extend LibreCores.org

[LibreCores](http://www.librecores.org) is a community web site with the goal of providing an overview of IP cores and the corresponding ecosystem. We strive for LibreCores to be *the* resource for free and open source IP: it should be easy to find, integrate, and contribute to the projects found there -- to make digital design projects as easy as writing software. For further information on our goals, see the [FOSDEM Presentation slides](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/digital_hardware_design/attachments/slides/1037/export/events/attachments/digital_hardware_design/slides/1037/fossi_fosdem.pdf) announcing LibreCores. The full site source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/librecores/librecores-web).

You can find a non-exhaustive [list of available tasks in our documentation](http://librecores-web.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html). Please talk to Philipp if you have other ideas, or didn't find an interesting project. We welcome your own ideas!

### Continuous Integration for Hardware Projects on LibreCores CI

*Goal:* Setup verification and continuous integration flow for one of open-source digital hardware projects.

*Details:*
[LibreCores CI](https://www.librecores.org/static/librecores-ci) is a
under-development Continuous Integration service within
[LibreCores](http://librecores.org). In this project we offer students
to work with modern hardware verification tools, RTL codebase and
[Jenkins Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/) in order to
setup efficient verification flows for one of the open-source hardware
project being hosted on LibreCores. The project includes improvements
of the HW project testability in RTL, development/improvement of
testing frameworks and a development of a new Pipeline Library for
automation in Jenkins.

Prerequisites:
* Basic knowledge of the hardware verification techniques
* Knowledge of one of RTL languages
* Knowledge of one of the scripting languages (preferably Python or Groovy)

*Skill Level:* Intermediate

*Language/Tools:* Verilog/VHDL/.../Python, Jenkins, Groovy

*Mentors:* [Oleg Nenashev](mailto:o.v.nenashev@gmail.com),

### Open SoC Debug: Efficient Control-Flow Traces

Trace debugging is the method to observe the execution of a
system-on-chip. The [Open SoC Debug](http://www.opensocdebug.org) project
creates open source building blocks for a debug infrastructure, with a
strong focus on efficient trace debugging.

Control Flow tracing (or instruction tracing) is the process of observing a program execution on a processor, and creating a "trace" from these observations, which allows a tool to re-create the program flow as it happened on-chip.

To transmit traces efficiently from the chip to the host PC, trace compression must be applied. This compression reduces all non-essential parts of the trace, reducing it to (typically) only jump instructions where the target cannot be determined using the program binary.

The goal of this project is to (a) find a good trace compression algorithm for instruction traces, and (b) implement it in System Verilog (on the hardware side) and C (on the software side) for the Open SoC Debug system.

*Skill Level*: Intermediate

*Language/Tools:* SystemVerilog, C

*Mentor:* [Philipp Wagner](mailto:mail@philipp-wagner.com)

### Open SoC Debug: Trace Logging to Memory

*Details*: In the [Open SoC Debug](http://opensocdebug.org) we
currently transfer traces from the debug target to the host for
on-line visualization or offline processing. But low level traces may
be interesting even while the system-on-chip is in the field, similar
to system traces, e.g. from Linux. The idea is to write the traces to
a reserved space in the system memory and read them from the running
software.

Basically this idea involves two hardware tasks: A configuration
interface for trace logging and the interface between the debug
interconnect and the system memory. Ideally your proof-of-concept
includes a simple software. This setup can be optimized for example
with trace compression and circular buffering.

*Skill level*: Intermediate

*Language/Tools*: System Verilog

*Mentor:* [Stefan Wallentowitz](mailto:stefan@wallentowitz.de)


### Open SoC Debug: Run-Control Debugging

*Details*: [Open SoC Debug](http://opensocdebug.org) is a free and open debug and trace system for embedded systems.
Our current developments mainly focused on the tracing part, leaving run-control debug for this GSoC project!
By run-control debug we mean the process of firing up GDB, setting breakpoints in a program, and stepping through the program.
In last year's GSoC we already added the [hardware modules necessary for run-control debug](http://opensocdebug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_spec/07_modules/cdm/index.html).
This year we'll focus on [finishing the software part](https://github.com/opensocdebug/osd-sw/pull/20), and improving it to interact seamlessly with GDB.

*Skill level*: Intermediate

*Language/Tools*: C

*Mentor:* [Philipp Wagner](mailto:mail@philipp-wagner.com)

### OpTiMSoC: Extend the Linux Port

*Details:* The
[Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip](https://www.optimsoc.org) is a
prototyping platform for massively parallel multicore
system-on-chip. The main runtime environments we employ so far are
baremetal and a very lean operating system ("compute node OS").

It has basic Linux support on a single compute tile, but doesn't have many drivers for OpTiMSoC-specific functionality so far.
One example would be a driver to send and receive messages over the Network-on-Chip (NoC).

The goal of this GSoC project is to extend the OpTiMSoC Linux port.
What extensions, you might ask? It's up to you!
How about enabling multi-core support? Or creating an extended device driver for our Network-on-Chip (NoC)? Or writing an accelerator interface to trigger computations in the compute grid of OpTiMSoC from software running on Linux? There's an endless stream of opportunities to choose from -- bring your own idea or get in touch with us to discuss ideas we have.

No matter which task you choose, you get unique insights into hardware (you can actually view the waveform of most signals in OpTiMSoC!) and Linux internals.

*Skill level:* Intermediate, Advanced

*Language/Tools*: Linux Kernel development (C), optional: FPGA synthesis flow

### Hardware Accelerated Web Applications
 
*Details:* The incorporation of FPGAs into the cloud makes it possible to combine the maturity of web and cloud infrastructure with the performance benefits of FPGA hardware acceleration. A web-based video game could provide live video chat where players are in character, with real-time voice and video processing in FPGAs. Or, maybe you'd like to quickly slap a web front-end on your graduate research project that uses FPGAs. The hardware infrastructure exists today to support this, but the software infrastructure is in it's infancy. In other words, there is HUGE opportunity to have impact in this space.

This project supports hardware acceleration of web applications by providing a communication channel between JavaScript, running in a web browser, and FPGA hardware, running on Amazon F1 FPGA instances or other FPGA hardware. [The project](https://github.com/alessandrocomodi/fpga-webserver) is off to a good start with a proof-of-concept implementation and a demo application hosted at [fractalvalley.net](http://fractalvalley.net).

*Mentor:* [Steve Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hoover-a44b607/) ([email](steve.hoover@redwoodeda.com))

Within this effort there are several possible summer project:
 
#### Evolve the demo application into a generic framework

This project, in it's current form, implements the complete communication framework, but in a proof-of-concept form entangled with the demo application. This summer project will cleanly refactor the code into a generic framework separate from the demo application.

Several technologies are involved. An F1 instance is a cloud CPU (host machine) with attached FPGAs. The host acts as a web server implemented using Python and [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/). Client JavaScript code communicates via REST or WebSockets with the server. The server relays the data stream to the attached FPGA where a custom hardware kernel processes the data. Output data is returned to the web client along a reverse path.

You're focus could be the hardware and/or software components of this communication. There may be an option of leveraging [Fletcher](https://github.com/johanpel/fletcher) for the host to FPGA kernel communication.

*Skill level:* Advanced

*Languages/Tools:* Amazon F1 infrastructure, C++, OpenCL, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, sockets/Web Sockets

#### Port to other FPGA platforms

Amazon F1 is accessible to everyone, but there are downsides to the platform as well. Provisioning is complicated, and although there is no up-front cost, the hardware can get expensive after a while. If you have access and experience with other FPGA hardware, let's give it a try.

*Skill level:* Advanced

*Languages/Tools:* FPGA expertise and access, C++, sockets.

#### Evolving fractalvalley.net

Fractals are endless fun. If you are excited about FPGA acceleration, but prefer front-end development, you can help the cause without touching the FPGA. The client code is a hack that grew. You can use the existing code as a point of reference for a re-write using a proper framework like Angular or React and code management with Node.js. Improve video capture and playback and incorporate a database of user-generated fractals. It's a well-sized fun summer project to play with various modern web technologies. Or, if you are a math geek, you can play with the fractal algorithms.
 
*Skill level:* Intermediate

*Languages/Tools:* JavaScript, HTML5, Angular/React, Node.js, OR C++, math, algorithms

#### Virtual Reality Fractals

There's a test feature enabling 3-D fractal navigation in a Google Cardboard VR viewer. It's pretty damn cool. There are many VR platforms that could be used to display FPGA-generated 3-D fractal navigations. You should be good with math and algorithms to be able to apply the Mandelbrot fractals to each platform.

*Skill level:* Intermediate

*Languages/Tools:* C++, VR platforms


### WARP-V RISC-V Core Generator

The WARP-V RISC-V core generator was developed in 2018, and was formally verified using open-source tools in last summer's GSoC.

WARP-V is the most-configurable, most-adaptable open-source RISC-V CPU core generator, taking advantage of advanced digital design features of TL-Verilog (see [makerchip.com](http://www.makerchip.com)). It can be configured as a low-power, slow-clock, single stage pipeline, a high-frequency seven-stage pipeline, or anywhere in between. You can even swap out the RISC-V ISA for a completely different ISA altogether.

As a participant in GSoC 2018, Akos Hadnagy formally verified all standard configurations of this design using open-source tools, in particular, Clifford Wolf's [riscv-formal](https://github.com/SymbioticEDA/riscv-formal). He subsequently presented his work at ORConf and VSD Open. There is plenty of information available from the [WARP-V repository](https://github.com/stevehoover/warp-v).

GSoC is your chance to be a part of this exciting effort which has received so much attention in so little time.

*Mentor:* [Steve Hoover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-hoover-a44b607/) ([email](steve.hoover@redwoodeda.com))

Within this effort, several areas of focus are possible:

#### CPU Components in Transaction-Level Verilog

WARP-V microarchtectural options can be extended. You can implement CPU components like branch predictors, caches, etc., and add support for RISC-V ISA extensions to provide rich configurability. You will learn CPU microarchitecture and advanced design practices with TL-Verilog.

*Skill level:* Advanced

*Languages/Tools:* TL-Verilog, Makerchip IDE

#### Physical Implementation of the WARP-V CPU

At this point, little focus has been placed on the physical implementation of WARP-V. Early data looks comparable to other RISC-V implementations, but better characterization is needed. This project is for a student with access and experience with FPGAs to implement and optimize various configurations of WARP-V.

*Skill level:* Intermediate/Advanced

*Languages/Tools:* TL-Verilog, Makerchip IDE, FPGA

#### Integration of WARP-V, Ariane, and OpenPiton

WARP-V provides the CPU core only. It does not include a memory subsystem, I/O, etc. This project will integrate WARP-V with an existing RISC-V SoC, such as Ariane+OpenPiton.

*Skill level:* Intermediate/Advanced

*Languages/Tools:* Verilog, TL-Verilog

*Additional Mentor:* Jonathan Balkind

#### Implement MIPS ISA in WARP-V

The MIPS ISA is in the process of becoming open. Licensing details are not yet fully available, but assuming details come to light and the ISA is truly open, MIPS can be implemented in WARP-V. Steve Hoover will lead the initial implementation (which should take a week or two), and the student will work out corner cases, verify the implementation, and qualify it through channels currently taking shape in the new MIPS ecosystem.

*Skill level:* Intermediate

*Languages/Tools:* TL-Verilog


### Extend a Transaction-Level Verilog Component Library

Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) is an emerging language extension to SystemVerilog that is introducing a number of game-changing capabilities. Among them is the ability to define flexible, reusable components--way more flexible than Verilog. For this project, you will extend [a library of compatible components](https://github.com/stevehoover/tlv_flow_lib) including FIFOs, queues, and arbiters that was developed as part of last year's GSoC by Ahmed Salman. This library has the potential to form the basis of a new era of hardware design. Ahmed presented his work at VSDOpen and published this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01780.pdf). In addition to developing components, you will demonstrate the ease of composing these components into sophisticated transaction flows and quickly implementing what are currently considered to be complex designs, such as a complete on-chip network!

*Skill level:* Advanced

*Language/Tools:* TL-Verilog, Makerchip IDE


### TL-Verilog Timing Reports

TL-Verilog improves the design process by providing high-level context for design details. There are benefits to relating information from down-stream (RTL and below) tools, back to TL-Verilog's higher-level context (hierarchy, pipelines, and transactions).

You'll build scripts to map RTL signal names to their original TL-Verilog names. You'll apply this to timing reports from open source synthesis tools so timing information can be reported with respect to TL-Verilog source code. You're contributions will help to elevate open-source design to a level above current industry practice.

*Skill level:* Intermediate

*Language/Tools:* QFlow, yosys, Perl/Python/other

*Additional Mentors:* Tim Edwards (to be confirmed--was interested last year)


### TL-Clash/TL-Chisel/TL-VHDL Definition

The TL-X specification defines “transaction-level” language extensions that can, in theory, be applied to any underlying hardware description language. Today there is only support for Verilog as TL-Verilog. Others, such as TL-Clash, TL-Chisel, and TL-VHDL could also be supported. The first step is to define them in more detail.

This project would provide a unique opportunity to write open source code that cannot be compiled! This will help to define the support required in compilers for these language variants, and it will expose the benefits. While it would be possible to implement support in [TLV-Comp](https://github.com/ypyatnychko/tlv-comp), this step may be left as a future project.

There is particular interest in TL-Clash, as it would combine the best of TL-X and Clash. TL-X is strong with sequential logic through its timing abstract modeling, and Clash is strong with combinational logic because of its advanced type system.

This is an advanced project requiring skills with hardware modeling and hardware and software language theory.

*Skill level:* Advanced

*Language/Tools:* TL-Verilog, Clash/Haskell, Chisel/Scala, VHDL

*Mentors:* Steve Hoover, Jan Kuper(?)
