              <div class="card-body">
		<p class="card-text">We are pleased to announce that Latch-Up 2020 will be held at <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu" title="MIT CSAIL">MIT CSAIL</a> (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) in the Stata Center. The venue's address is the Ray and Maria Stata Center at <A href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=32" target="_blank">32 Vassar St. Cambridge, MA </a>
		</p>
		<p>
		Directions from AoE start at <A href="http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/" target="_blank">Boston's Logan International airport.</a> There is free WiFi at Logan so you can get online before you leave there if you need to. Note that there is also free WiFi at MIT but not too many other places in Boston and Cambridge. Charging your portable electronics is also pretty easy to do at the airport if you have either a standard US power supply adapter or a USB cable. There are many other amenities at the airport but if you are looking to eat a traditional Colonial American meal, like brownbread and Joe Froggers, or clam chowder, please do wait until you get downtown.
		</p>

		<p>
		If you want to exchange money you should do that at the airport. There are <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/city/23/bitcoin-atm-boston/"> local Bitcoin ATMs</A>.
		</p>

		<p>
		There are the usual ride share and taxi options, but we strongly suggest public transportation. Take the MBTA Silver Line since it is free from the airport and comes around approximately every 10 minutes. Indeed, the <a href="https://www.mbta.com/schedules/741/schedule?direction_id=1&origin=27092#origin" title="MIT CSAIL">"next bus"</A> arrival is posted on the MBTA amber text crawlers at the airport terminals as well as the <a href="https://www.mbta.com/mbta-endorsed-apps/"> MBTA-approved phone apps.</A> There is only one Silver Line airport route (SL1) and when it comes by your terminal, take it.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Silver Line route terminates at South Station which is where you want to transfer to the Alewife Red Line and ride it for 4 stops to Kendall / MIT. This will still be free of charge as long as you do not leave the subway system until you get to MIT. Technically the Silver Line is a a <a href="https://www.mbta.com/history" title="MIT CSAIL"> trackless trolley, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.T.A._(song)"> Boston anachronism </A>. Don't take the Blue Line, that is a much less direct path. The MBTA turnstiles only recognize Charlie RFID Cards or Charlie (paper) Tickets which you can buy at any subway stop. The Mass Turnpike Authority recognizes most other state's FastPass transponders if you are driving. They are used only on I-90 and the Mystic River Bridge, which will likely not affect attendees. All rental cars have them as a standard. Most buses and trains coming from points west and south arrive at South Station.
	        </p>
		<p>
		There is free parking at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mitdlbc/www/parking.htm">certain MIT lots</A> starting on Friday evening.
		</p>
		<p>
		<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/K63MqjoWm6EZEDpQ">Walking Directions from the Kendall / MIT T stop</A> which is at 350 Main St. The Stata Center is on the corner of Main and Vassar right next to 401 Main street. It is only a 5 minute walk north up Main street. The Cambridge Marriott hotel is also right there at the T stop in case you came by taxi.

		<p class="card-text">
On Friday April 10, the day before Latch-Up, we will host a FPGA workshop showcasing 100% Open Source tool chain on the Open Hardware OrangeCrab.
<p>
This will be suitable for anyone interested the Latch-Up event. FPGA hacking doesn’t have to be the scary thing it used to be. You will be loaned an OrangeCrab FPGA board and lead though the process of installing the tools and source code needed to build an SoC that runs either Linux or Python.
<p>
If you are wondering who needs an FPGA to run a high level system, no one does. But for problems that do need an FPGA, the solution likely will need a way to interface with other things both hardware and users. That task is made easier by having control of a high level environment on the same silicon. It also gives the developer the ability to inspect the FPGA with something more inviting than an oscilloscope. These two reasons apply to production use, and having something more sophisticated than a blinking LED makes for a good educational goal.
<p>
Once you have the high level parts in place, you now have the tools to build more than just a blinking LED.
<p>
Get a head start on the workshop and a taste of what is going on:

		<p>
		  Latch-Up 2020 in Cambridge (MA US) opens a new chapter for the FOSSi Foundation, with it being the second event in the spirit of ORConf held in North America. Latch-Up is a community-focused conference for open source semiconductor, digital design and embedded systems professionals and enthusiasts. Expect presentations on a wide range of topics; open source IP blocks and SoCs, open source simulators, compilers, synthesis and physical implementation tools for both FPGA and ASIC.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Latch-Up aims to bring together the North American open source digital design community for an event in the mould of ORConf - the FOSSi Foundation’s annual European community conference. Like ORConf, Latch-Up will be will be free to attend and consist of a relaxed format of presentations and discussions throughout a weekend, with plenty of time for networking. A dinner on the Saturday evening will be arranged and all attendees are invited to attend.
	      </p>
		<p>
		  These events go to the FOSSi Foundation's goal of lowering barriers of entry to the digital design field, whilst encouraging the open source
		  development model and promoting open collaboration.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We recognise the keen interest in this area in the Americas and this year are putting effort into organizing an event which will encourage wider awareness amongst enthusiasts of the projects that we’ve been hearing about at ORConf since 2012.

                  <a name="minimax" href="#minimax"></a>Minimax - a Compressed-First, Microcoded RISC-V CPU</h4>
		<p>
		  RISC-V's compressed instruction (RVC) extension is intended as
		  an add-on to the regular instruction set. Thought experiment:
		  can a RISC-V CPU directly execute only the RVC instructions,
		  and emulate the uncompressed instruction set in microcode? The
		  result is Minimax: the smallest¹, fastest² RV32IC core
		  available - with the weasel words hidden in the fine print.
		  In this presentation, I will show how Minimax fits in with
		  the other excellent open-source RISC-V cores already available.

		<p>
		  Space applications present special challenges to open source
		  technologies including high reliability and harsh environment.
		  LeWiz Communications published several open source IP cores
		  including Ethernet, RISC-V with network protocols and
		  providing complete verification suites, design examples, etc.
		  These are now targeted for space applications with specific
		  space mission targets. This talk presents potential
		  opportunities for space usage, the available open source
		  technologies, challenges to space applications and uses
		  actual applications to provide examples. Finally, it will
		  call on the open source community to contribute to areas
		  still lacking support for FPGA and ASIC implementations
		  targeted for space applications.

		<h4>
                  <a name="neuromorphic" href="#neuromorphic"></a>Open Source Brain-Inspired Neuromorphic Software and Hardware</h4>
		<p>
		  The brain is the perfect place to look for inspiration to
		  develop more efficient neural networks. One of the main
		  differences with modern deep learning is that the brain
		  encodes and processes information as spikes rather than
		  continuous, high-precision activations. This presentation
		  will dive into how the open-source ecosystem has been used
		  to develop brain-inspired neuromorphic accelerators, from
		  our development of a Python training library for spiking
		  neural networks (snnTorch, >60,000 downloads), to compiling
		  these next-generation deep learning models on custom ASICs
		  submitted for tape-out in the Sky130 process. The open-source
		  silicon movement has the potential to impact how we adopt
		  principles from neuroscience to improving deep learning and
		  hardware acceleration.

		<h4>
                  <a name="constellation" href="#constellation"></a>Constellation: A Open-Source Chisel Generator for Network-on-Chip Interconnects</h4>
		<p>
		  In response to growing application diversity, System-on-Chip
		  (SoC) architectures have become increasingly heterogeneous,
		  with diverse cores and accelerators, as well as non-uniform
		  memory systems. However, existing open-source design
		  frameworks for SoCs and NoCs (Network-on-Chips) have been
		  unable to facilitate design exploration of heterogeneous SoC
		  architectures with irregular NoCs. We present Constellation,
		  a new NoC RTL generator framework designed from the ground up
		  to support integration in a heterogeneous SoC and evaluation
		  of highly irregular NoC architectures. Constellation
		  implements a highly decoupled specification system that allows
		  an architect to specify an exponentially large design space of
		  irregular virtual-channel wormhole-routed NoC architectures.
		  Additionally, Constellation provides a diverse set of systems,
		  regression tests, and evaluation tools to provide confidence
		  in the correctness and performance of the generated hardware.
		  Constellation is open-sourced and integrated into the Chipyard
		  SoC design framework, allowing full-system exploration of
		  heterogeneous SoC architectures with irregular memory fabrics.

                  <a name="siliconcompiler" href="#siliconcompiler"></a>Goodbye Make, Hello SiliconCompiler!</h4>
		<p>
		  SiliconCompiler is a modern replacement of "make" that
		  leverages the cloud and modern programming frameworks to
		  lower the barrier to hardware development.
		  (https://github.com/siliconcompiler/). The project has been
		  successfully used in sky130 shuttle run designs and in
		  multiple SoCs at advanced FinFET nodes. This session will give
		  an overview of the project, followed by a set of short demos
		  showing interesting use cases.

		<h4>
                  <a name="firesim" href="#firesim"></a>FireSim: A Scalable Platform for FPGA-Accelerated Simulation, Debugging, and Profiling of RTL Designs</h4>
		<p>
		  FireSim is an easy-to-use, open-source, FPGA-accelerated
		  hardware simulation platform that runs on cloud and
		  on-premises FPGAs, including AWS EC2 F1 and local machines
		  with Xilinx Alveo boards. FireSim automatically instruments
		  and transforms RTL designs into fast (10s-100s MHz),
		  deterministic, and cycle-exact FPGA-based simulators that
		  enable productive pre-silicon verification and performance
		  validation. Users can plug in their own designs or harness
		  the included Chipyard SoC design environment, which includes
		  in-order and out-of-order RISC-V cores, uncore components,
		  peripherals, and accelerators. In contrast with traditional
		  FPGA prototyping, FireSim includes synthesizable and
		  timing-accurate models for standard I/O interfaces like DRAM,
		  Ethernet, UART, and others, allowing users to obtain accurate
		  performance measurements for their pre-silicon design. FireSim
		  also provides a large array of debugging and profiling
		  features not available in FPGA prototypes, including assertion
		  synthesis, print synthesis, out-of-band instruction trace and
		  performance counter recording, Flame Graph integration, and
		  co-simulation with software models. These features enable
		  rapidly debugging and profiling designs trillions of cycles
		  into simulation, without perturbing design behavior. By
		  providing a framework to automate the management of FPGA
		  infrastructure, FireSim lets hardware and software developers
		  get a head-start on building software for novel hardware
		  designs, by letting developers interact with the pre-silicon
		  hardware design as they would a virtual machine. In effect,
		  both hardware and software developers can work from a single
		  source of truth: the RTL for the hardware design. FireSim also
		  scales to simulating thousands of multi-core compute nodes,
		  including the ability to simulate large clusters of networked
		  designs over hundreds of FPGAs. By providing a consistent,
		  user-friendly interface for managing simulations, FireSim
		  enables easy scaling from small numbers of simulations hosted
		  by on-premises FPGAs to massive simulations using hundreds of
		  FPGAs on the cloud. This allows FireSim to remove the high
		  capex traditionally involved in large-scale FPGA-based
		  simulation, democratizing access to realistic pre-silicon
		  hardware modeling of new designs. By defining standardized
		  host platforms and providing a large amount of
		  automation/tooling, FireSim drastically simplifies the process
		  of building and deploying large-scale FPGA-based hardware
		  simulations. To date, FireSim has been used in the development
		  of commercial silicon and in published work from authors at
		  over 20 academic and industrial institutions across various
		  areas including computer architecture, systems, networking,
		  circuits, security, and HPC.

                  <a name="chipyard" href="#chipyard"></a>Chipyard: An Open-Source RISC-V SoC Design Framework</h4>
		<p>
		  We present Chipyard - an open-source integrated system-on-chip
		  (SoC) design, simulation, and implementation environment for
		  specialized RISC-V compute systems. Chipyard includes
		  parameterized, composable, open-source, generator-based IP
		  blocks that can be used across multiple stages of the hardware
		  development flow while maintaining design intent and
		  integration consistency. Through FPGA simulation and rapid
		  ASIC implementation, this framework allows for continuous
		  validation of physically realizable customized systems.
		  Through integration with the Rocket Chip generator ecosystem,
		  Chipyard provides a large number of easily composable and
		  extensible open-source digital IP blocks including
		  Linux-capable cores, accelerators, and system components.
		  Chipyard contains mainstream energy-efficient and
		  high-performance processor cores (Rocket, SonicBOOM, CVA6,
		  Ibex, Sodor), domain specific accelerators
		  (Hwacha/Gemmini/NVDLA vector/ML, SHA3/FFT/Mempress misc.),
		  memory systems (caches, scratchpads, DRAMSim2), on-chip
		  interconnects (Constellation) and additional peripherals to
		  help create a fully featured SoC. Chipyard enables
		  customization through intra-core and inter-core configuration,
		  as well as custom extensions using the Rocket Custom
		  Co-processor (RoCC) interface and MMIO-based devices. Chipyard
		  also allows users to seamlessly integrate their own
		  SystemVerilog custom IPs. Additionally, Chipyard provides
		  software workload management tooling (FireMarshal) and
		  toolchains for users to generate custom baremetal and
		  Linux-based workloads for generated custom SoCs. As the SoC is
		  co-designed for a specific use case, Chipyard enables pushing
		  the entire SoC through automated ASIC flows (e.g. Hammer),
		  software simulation (e.g. Verilator), FPGA prototyping flows
		  (e.g. Vivado), and FPGA-accelerated simulation flows (e.g.
		  FireSim). This allows the user to measure their workloads of
		  interest in a fully automated way. Harnessing the integration
		  with the Hammer ASIC physical design framework, users can run
		  power-analysis simulation, go from gates to a GDSII, and more,
		  in a minimal amount of time in both commercial and open-source
		  process technologies (SKY130) and tooling (OpenRoad). For
		  pre-silicon simulation and prototyping, users can use
		  Verilator or FPGA prototyping for quick design/test cycle. For
		  even faster continuous and simultaneous development for
		  higher-quality verification and validation, users can use the
		  FireSim FPGA-accelerated simulation platform for additional
		  scale, accuracy, and debuggability. In this talk, we cover
		  how the open-source Chipyard “one-stop shop” SoC framework
		  enables users to create, integrate, test, and measure their
		  own hardware designs. To date Chipyard has enabled end-to-end
		  computer architecture research and development in over 15
		  academic and industrial institutions across all domains.

		<p>
		  Checkers are a critical part of the design verification
		  process. With the advent of constrained-random techniques, a
		  lot of stimulus-generation capabilities are supported by
		  languages, methodologies, and supporting tools. Ensuring that
		  a design behaves as per the specification is achieved using
		  various forms of checkers. The term “checker” at times means
		  different things to different people. With SystemVerilog 2009
		  standard making “checker” as a keyword in the language
		  itself, we would like to use that for temporal checks using
		  assertions. Verilator is a free and open-source simulator that
		  can convert SystemVerilog code into a cycle-accurate
		  executable model. Assertions are statements that specify
		  properties or constraints that the design should satisfy. In
		  this paper, we present our experience in porting some of our
		  Checker IPs (APB, AHB, etc.) developed and used in production
		  to Verilator. Given the SVA support is still maturing in
		  Verilator, our team had to adapt the code to be restricted to
		  what the tool supports. We also developed unit tests to verify
		  these properties in Verilator. We will share our findings,
		  potential areas to improve, etc. Our intention is to make this
		  code base available as part of GO2UVM library.

		<p>
		  We've all had the harrowing experience of hand-coding our

		  then painstakingly transcribing it to software header files.
		  What could possibly go wrong? If only we could automate this!
		  Fortunately there is a growing ecosystem of

		  SystemRDL - a register description design-entry language
		  <a href="https://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemrdl">published by Accellera</a>.
		  SystemRDL lets you describe countless types of registers
		  containing various access policies, counters, interrupts, and
		  other commonly used CSR constructs. Using this language, you
		  can build an information-rich single source of truth for all
		  your register automation needs. This presentation will
		  introduce a set of open-source tools developed specifically
		  around SystemRDL. At the core is the <a href="https://systemrdl-compiler.readthedocs.io">SystemRDL compiler front-end</a>
		  that handles the RDL language processing and provides an
		  intuitive Python API for register automation developers. Also
		  featured is the toolchain called <a href="https://peakrdl.readthedocs.io">PeakRDL</a>,
		  which uses this compiler to generate
		  <a href="https://peakrdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html">various outputs</a>

		<p>
		  Simulation threads in RTL testbenches are essential for
		  writing modular, scalable, and reusable verification IPs.
		  Ideally one could write testbenches in a general-purpose
		  programming language, instead of SystemVerilog, to take
		  advantage of the language's standard library, package

		  testbench libraries that support the fork/join construct
		  suffer significant performance penalties caused by the
		  implementation of fork/join in the host language. We propose

                  <a name="bsgtag" href="#bsgtag"></a>bsg_tag: A minimal open-source ASIC configuration bus</h4>
		<p>
		  Digital designs often contain a large number of configuration
		  registers needed to bring up the chip. These may represent
		  clock sources, resets, enable bits, global id settings, IP
		  modes, or other static configuration. To avoid bootstrapping
		  problems, it's necessary to be able to control these
		  registers from outside of the chip itself. For reset and
		  bringup procedures, designs require precise and robust
		  sequencing. However, GPIOs can be extremely expensive in
		  terms of area (especially on small designs in an MPW run), so
		  controlling these registers must be done with as few pins as
		  possible. Complex designs can have hundreds or thousands of
		  configuration bits, so there needs to be a higher level
		  protocol which can scale from this minimal number of actual
		  I/Os. We present bsg_tag, which is a decentralized
		  source-synchronous bus and protocol layer for ASIC
		  configuration. bsg_tag creates a powerful abstraction where
		  with a few pins, you can reach inside your chip at high
		  bandwidth and set any register while the chip is running, no
		  matter what clock domain that register is in. From this
		  abstraction, we can build many more powerful mechanisms.
		  Unlike other standard configuration methodologies, bsg_tag is
		  non-invasive, requiring minimal RTL changes and integrates
		  seamlessly into existing IP blocks. bsg_tag is fast, robust
		  and gracefully handles synchronized crossing into local clock
		  domains. bsg_tag is battle-tested has been used in many
		  academic and commercial tapeouts, usually being the first
		  functionality tested in a bringup procedure. This talk will
		  discuss the physical and protocol layers of bsg_tag, as well
		  as and demo software infrastructure built up for simple
		  interactive debugging. Come learn how to simplify bringup of
		  your next SoC!

		  While SystemVerilog is the most widely-used language for
		  creating functional verification testbench environments, many
		  different language are used as well. In the past decade or
		  so, Python has risen in popularity as a verification
		  language. The open-source Python ecosystem for functional
		  verification provides many of the expected elements of any
		  other functional verification flow, such as libraries for
		  connecting Python to simulators, frameworks for structuring
		  testbench environments, and bus functional models for
		  specific protocols. However, until recently, the it did not
		  provide support for specifying data-randomization constraints
		  and functional coverage metrics in a way that SystemVerilog
		  users would find familiar. This presentation will introduce
		  PyVSC, an open-source Python library for modeling
		  SystemVerilog-style data randomization constraints and
		  functional coverage metrics in Python. It will describe the
		  constraint and coverage features that can be modeled with
		  PyVSC, and describe how PyVSC leverages existing SMT solvers
		  to generate random data from complex sets of constraints. It
		  will describe how functional coverage data collected by PyVSC
		  can be exported to support manipulation by external flows and

		  flow generator that reduces design effort and increases
