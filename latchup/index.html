		<p class="card-text">We are pleased to announce that Latch-Up 2020 will be held at <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu" title="MIT CSAIL">MIT CSAIL</a> (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) in the Stata Center. The venue's address is the Ray and Maria Stata Center at <A href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=32" target="_blank">32 Vassar St. Cambridge, MA </a>
		</p>
		<p>
		Directions from AoE start at <A href="http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/" target="_blank">Boston's Logan International airport.</a> There is free WiFi at Logan so you can get online before you leave there if you need to. Note that there is also free WiFi at MIT but not too many other places in Boston and Cambridge. Charging your portable electronics is also pretty easy to do at the airport if you have either a standard US power supply adapter or a USB cable. There are many other amenities at the airport but if you are looking to eat a traditional Colonial American meal, like brownbread and Joe Froggers, or clam chowder, please do wait until you get downtown.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		If you want to exchange money you should do that at the airport. There are <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/city/23/bitcoin-atm-boston/"> local Bitcoin ATMs</A>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		There are the usual ride share and taxi options, but we strongly suggest public transportation. Take the MBTA Silver Line since it is free from the airport and comes around approximately every 10 minutes. Indeed, the <a href="https://www.mbta.com/schedules/741/schedule?direction_id=1&origin=27092#origin" title="MIT CSAIL">"next bus"</A> arrival is posted on the MBTA amber text crawlers at the airport terminals as well as the <a href="https://www.mbta.com/mbta-endorsed-apps/"> MBTA-approved phone apps.</A> There is only one Silver Line airport route (SL1) and when it comes by your terminal, take it.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Silver Line route terminates at South Station which is where you want to transfer to the Alewife Red Line and ride it for 4 stops to Kendall / MIT. This will still be free of charge as long as you do not leave the subway system until you get to MIT. Technically the Silver Line is a a <a href="https://www.mbta.com/history" title="MIT CSAIL"> trackless trolley, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.T.A._(song)"> Boston anachronism </A>. Don't take the Blue Line, that is a much less direct path. The MBTA turnstiles only recognize Charlie RFID Cards or Charlie (paper) Tickets which you can buy at any subway stop. The Mass Turnpike Authority recognizes most other state's FastPass transponders if you are driving. They are used only on I-90 and the Mystic River Bridge, which will likely not affect attendees. All rental cars have them as a standard. Most buses and trains coming from points west and south arrive at South Station. 
	        </p>
		<p>
		There is free parking at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/mitdlbc/www/parking.htm">certain MIT lots</A> starting on Friday evening.

		<p>
		<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/K63MqjoWm6EZEDpQ">Walking Directions from the Kendall / MIT T stop</A> which is at 350 Main St. The Stata Center is on the corner of Main and Vassar right next to 401 Main street. It is only a 5 minute walk north up Main street. The Cambridge Marriott hotel is also right there at the T stop in case you came by taxi.

		<p class="card-text">
On Friday April 10, the day before Latch-Up, we will host a FPGA workshop showcasing 100% Open Source tool chain on the Open Hardware OrangeCrab.
<p>
This will be suitable for anyone interested the Latch-Up event. FPGA hacking doesn’t have to be the scary thing it used to be. You will be loaned an OrangeCrab FPGA board and lead though the process of installing the tools and source code needed to build an SoC that runs either Linux or Python.
<p>
If you are wondering who needs an FPGA to run a high level system, no one does. But for problems that do need an FPGA, the solution likely will need a way to interface with other things both hardware and users. That task is made easier by having control of a high level environment on the same silicon. It also gives the developer the ability to inspect the FPGA with something more inviting than an oscilloscope. These two reasons apply to production use, and having something more sophisticated than a blinking LED makes for a good educational goal.
<p>
Once you have the high level parts in place, you now have the tools to build more than just a blinking LED.
<p>
Get a head start on the workshop and a taste of what is going on:

		  Technically speaking, latch-up is a short circuit, an inadvertent path of low-impedance. We have co-opted this word to represent what we’d like to encourage among members of the community: paths of communication leading to collaboration, inadvertent or not.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Latch-Up 2020 in Cambridge (MA US) opens a new chapter for the FOSSi Foundation, with it being the second event in the spirit of ORConf held in North America. Latch-Up is a community-focused conference for open source semiconductor, digital design and embedded systems professionals and enthusiasts. Expect presentations on a wide range of topics; open source IP blocks and SoCs, open source simulators, compilers, synthesis and physical implementation tools for both FPGA and ASIC.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Latch-Up aims to bring together the North American open source digital design community for an event in the mould of ORConf - the FOSSi Foundation’s annual European community conference. Like ORConf, Latch-Up will be will be free to attend and consist of a relaxed format of presentations and discussions throughout a weekend, with plenty of time for networking. A dinner on the Saturday evening will be arranged and all attendees are invited to attend.
	      </p>
		<p>
		  These events go to the FOSSi Foundation's goal of lowering barriers of entry to the digital design field, whilst encouraging the open source
		  development model and promoting open collaboration.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We recognise the keen interest in this area in the Americas and this year are putting effort into organizing an event which will encourage wider awareness amongst enthusiasts of the projects that we’ve been hearing about at ORConf since 2012.

		<p>
		  Reducing power consumption has always been a primary design goal
		  for circuit designer and the driving force behind a variety of
		  products ranging from server-class chips to battery-operated
		  IoT devices. Recently, the advent of open-source concept in
		  various stages of circuit design promises great portability,
		  flexibility and customizability. Meanwhile, open-source also
		  introduces new design challenges.
		</p>
		<p>
		  I argue that with increasing demands from application space,
		  the interaction between low-power design with open-source
		  availability offers a bright future in terms of development cost
		  and enables broader collaborative efforts.
		</p>
		<p>
		  In this talk, I will overview the opportunities and challenges
		  specifically in low power design with various levels of open-source
		  hardware.

                  <a name="cocotbtask" href="#cocotbtask"></a>Speeding up cocotb Verification with Task-Based BFMs</h4>
		<p>
		  Cocotb provides a framework for cosimulating a testbench written
		  in Python with an HDL design and design written in SystemVerilog,
		  Verilog, or VHDL. Cocotb provides APIs for interacting with the
		  HDL environment at the signal level, and will soon provide the
		  ability to interact with the HDL environment via task calls.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Interacting with the HDL environment via task calls can improve
		  overall performance by an order of magnitude. This talk provides
		  an introduction to task-based bus functional models (BFMs) for
		  the cocotb environment, and provides a tutorial on writing task-based BFMs.

		<p>
		  Want to run Linux with RISC-V on Open Source Hardware?
		  This talk will explore the current options including how open
		  source FPGA tools can be leveraged to build open Linux-capable systems.
		</p>
		<p>
		  I will explain how myself and others at Hackaday Supercon teamed
		  up to get Linux running on RISC-V core in the ECP5 FPGA badge
		  using only open source tools thanks to Project Trellis, yosys
		  and nextpnr.  I will explain what migen and LiteX are, and how
		  it enabled us to quickly build a System-on-Chip (SoC) capable of
		  running Linux on VexRiscv.
		</p>
		<p>
		  In conclusion, I will explore the landscape of open source chip
		  design projects and the Linux-capable RISC-V silicon chips on
		  horizon for 2020, and talk about my desire to collaborate on an
		  affordable (&lt;$100?) OSHW Linux RISC-V board.

                  <a name="fossicompiler" href="#fossicompiler"></a>Building an open source silicon compiler</h4>
		<p>
		  In 2018 DARPA stood up research programs in EDA (IDEA) and
		  open source hardware (POSH) to address the exploding cost and
		  complexity of modern chip design. The goal of these programs
		  is to create an intelligent hardware compiler capable of
		  automatically generating tapeout ready GDSII databases directly
		  from source code and schematics.
		</p>
		<p>
		  This talk will give an overview of these research programs and
		  give a status update on the many open source tools that have
		  come out of the program to date.

		<h4>
                  <a name="formalriscv" href="#formalriscv"></a>Formal methods for hardware-software integration on RISC-V embedded systems</h4>
		<p>
		  Traditional systems integration of software, compilers and
		  hardware into an embedded systems stack relies on documentation
		  which is often imprecise and incomplete, and on extensive testing,
		  which can never cover all possible scenarios.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We propose a way to improve this tedious and error-prone process:
		  For each interface in an embedded systems stack, we write down a
		  formal, machine-readable interface specification, and using a
		  proof checker called Coq, we exhaustively verify that each layer
		  in our stack conforms to its interface specifications.
		  This allows us to prove an end to end correctness theorem about
		  our systems stack describing the behavior of the complete system
		  in terms of just the specification of the highest and the lowest layer.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We used this methodology to develop from scratch a simple systems
		  stack consisting of a high-level language to describe IO behavior,
		  a compiler for a C-like language, and a pipelined RISC-V processor.
		  Using this stack, we developed a protype IoT device running on
		  an FPGA connected to a lightbulb and a network card to demonstrate
		  the feasability of our approach.

		<h4>
                  <a name="pdvl" href="#pdvl"></a>Converting an Executable Spec from PDVL to SystemVerilog</h4>
		<p>
		  First, an open source tool is introduced, which converts a
		  grammar into an executable parser and writer (based on a grammar
		  for PDVL or SystemVerilog for instance). The resulting
		  database-structure can be accessed by C++ routines.
		</p>
		<p>
		  This tool is used for the PDVL to SystemVerilog Converter which
		  is introduced in the second part. It shows how executable specs
		  (e.g. RISC-V) written in PDVL can be automatically converted
		  and merged to an SoC in SystemVerilog.

                  <a name="hammer" href="#hammer"></a>Hammer: Enabling Re-usability in Physical Design</h4>
		<p>
		  Physical designers spend a non-trivial amount of time because
		  traditional physical design methodologies do not enable designers
		  on different projects to efficiently share effort with each other.
		  We present an open-source library and framework, Hammer, to
		  enable designers to share effort with each other through
		  separation of concerns. Hammer provides APIs and abstractions
		  to enable designs to share effort across projects with different
		  CAD tools, technologies, and architectures.

		  Makerchip is a free online platform for open-source integrated
		  circuit design, provided by Massachusetts startup, Redwood
		  EDA. In addition to Verilog and SystemVerilog, Makerchip
		  supports the emerging Transaction-Level Verilog standard. This
		  talk will illustrate rapid open-source development in Makerchip.
		  It will provide a taste of how TL-Verilog is taking circuit
		  design to the next level and describe how these technologies
		  are influencing open-source silicon. Projects built using
		  Makerchip and TL-Verilog and deployed to cloud FPGAs will be

		  hardware simulation platform that runs on Amazon EC2 F1. FireSim
		  automatically instruments and transforms RTL designs into fast
		  (10s-100s MHz), deterministic, FPGA-based simulators that enable
		  productive pre-silicon verification and performance validation.
		  Users can plug in their own designs or harness the included
		  Chipyard SoC design environment, which includes in-order and
		  out-of-order RISC-V cores, uncore components, peripherals, and
		  accelerators.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Like FPGA prototypes, FireSim allows users to validate and
		  verify their RTL designs at FPGA-speeds. Unlike FPGA prototypes,
		  FireSim includes synthesizeable and timing-accurate models for
		  standard I/O interfaces like DRAM, Ethernet, UART, and others,
		  allowing users to obtain accurate performance measurements for
		  their design, pre-silicon. FireSim also provides a large array
		  of debugging and profiling features not available in FPGA
		  prototypes, including assertion synthesis, printf synthesis,
		  out-of-band instruction trace and performance counter recording,
		  and Flame Graph integration. These tools enable rapidly
		  introspecting on a design deep into simulation time.
		</p>
		<p>
		  By providing a framework to automate the management of FPGA
		  infrastructure, FireSim lets hardware and software developers
		  get a head-start on building software for novel hardware designs,
		  by letting developers interact with the pre-silicon hardware
		  design as they would a virtual machine. In effect, both hardware
		  and software developers can work from a single source of truth:
		  the RTL for the hardware design. FireSim also scales to simulating
		  thousands of multi-core compute nodes, including the ability to
		  simulate large clusters of networked designs over hundreds of FPGAs.
		  Leveraging AWS EC2 F1, FireSim removes the high capex traditionally
		  involved in large-scale FPGA-based simulation, democratizing access
		  to realistic pre-silicon hardware modeling of new designs. For
		  designs that contain RISC-V SoCs, FireSim also provides compatible
		  Linux distributions (Buildroot, Fedora) and automates the process
		  of building complex workloads on top of these Linux distributions.
		  By harnessing a standardized host platform and providing a large
		  amount of automation/tooling, FireSim drastically simplifies the
		  process of building and deploying large-scale FPGA-based hardware
		  simulations.

		<h4>
                  <a name="fichte" href="#fichte"></a>Fichte: A Tool for Fast RTL-Based Design Space Exploration of RISC-V Multicore Processors</h4>
		<p>
		  In this work, we introduce a platform for register-transfer
		  level (RTL) architecture design space exploration. The platform
		  is an open-source, parameterized, synthesizable set of RTL
		  modules for designing RISC-V based single and multi-core
		  architecture systems. The platform is designed with a high degree
		  of modularity. It provides highly-parameterized, composable RTL
		  modules for fast and accurate exploration of different RISC-V
		  based core complexities, multi-level caching and memory
		  organizations, system topologies, router architectures, and
		  routing schemes. The platform can be used for both RTL simulation
		  and FPGA based emulation. The hardware modules are implemented
		  in synthesizable Verilog using no vendor-specific blocks. The
		  platform supports a myriad of RISC-V architectures, ranging
		  from a simple single cycle processor to a multi-core SoC with
		  a complex memory hierarchy and a network-on-chip. The modules
		  are designed to support incremental additions and modifications.
		  The interfaces between components are particularly designed to
		  allow parts of the processor such as whole cache modules, cores
		  or individual pipeline stages, to be modified or replaced without
		  impacting the rest of the system. The platform allows designers
		  to quickly instantiate complete working RISC-V multi-core systems
		  with synthesizable RTL and make targeted modifications to fit their needs.

		<p>
		  Large scale integrated circuits have been around for about 50
		  years and have touched every corner of our lives. Many circuit
		  designs, especially those related to home computers or video
		  game consoles, have great historical value. Unfortunately
		  hardware designs are difficult to preserve, as they can be
		  hidden inside custom microchips.
		</p>
		<p>
		  This presentation will give a high-level overview of the process
		  and challenges faced converting a physical chip into Verilog.
		  Much has been accomplished since presenting at last year's
		  Latchup. Many more chips have been added to the conversion
		  pipeline. I'll show off new tools such as a revamped transistor
		  level simulator and methods to automatically highlight chips
		  using ML. Finally, we'll look at future goals of the project,
		  such as more complex logic designs.
