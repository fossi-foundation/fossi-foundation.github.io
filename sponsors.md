The FOSSi Foundation seeks sponsors to help our
mission of supporting the community, open source design reuse, standards,
and licensing.

We are continually aiming to improve and scale up our activities, such as LibreCores, our
conferences, our GSoC mentorship participation, and our committees.

You can find more information about [sponsoring the FOSSi Foundation](sponsoring) on our [sponsorship page](sponsoring).

We extend an enormous thanks to everyone who has contributed to our mission.
